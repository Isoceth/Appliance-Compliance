# Appliance Compliance

This repository collects my Home Assistant configuration pieces that will be published to GitHub for blueprint imports and future automations. It is intended to stay in sync with the setup running on my home system.

## Contents
- `automations/` – YAML automations that power routine behaviors.
- `blueprints/` – shareable blueprints that can be imported into Home Assistant.

## Usage
1. Clone the repo locally or download the files into your Home Assistant config directory.
2. Import any blueprint YAML via the Home Assistant UI to enable quick setup.
3. Track changes here before pushing updates upstream so the live system stays consistent.

Feel free to fork or adapt the configurations to suit your own installation.
